# About

This is a simple chrome web extension that will automatically redeem the channel point bonus chests in a Twitch stream.
<br>
You can simply AFK in a channel (with the tab opened and active) and the extension will do the work for you!

# How to Use

~~You may install the app through the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chest-redeemer/ampjopbjfelpdciopicpkmiobbokbgad).~~
<br>
Alternatively, you can load it into chrome as an unpacked extension manually.
<br>
<br>
To do so, follow these relatively simple steps:
- Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and select the "Load unpacked" button on the top left of the screen.
- Locate the folder where you've cloned this repo and click "Select folder"
- The extension should load automatically and after reloading Twitch, you should be good to go!
